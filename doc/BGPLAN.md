‚è∫ Background Task System Implementation Plan

  1. Task Priority System

  - Create an enum class TaskPriority with levels: Critical, High, Normal, Low
  - Add priority to AsyncTask to allow scheduling based on importance
  - Make analysis tasks lower priority than UI-responsive commands

  2. Enhanced Task Manager

  - Develop a centralized TaskManager to replace the current AsyncTaskManager
  - Implement concurrent command queues with priority scheduling
  - Use mutex for radare2 API access for thread safety
  - Add task dependencies to prevent race conditions

  3. Command Queue System

  - Create a serialized command queue for radare2 commands
  - Implement mutex-protected access to radare2 API
  - Allow UI thread to post quick commands with higher priority

  4. Specific Implementation for Key Features

  Analysis Tasks:
  - Move initial analysis (aa/aaa/aaaa) to background thread
  - Add progress reporting via signals
  - Allow task interruption with proper cleanup

  Debugger Operations:
  - Queue stepping/continuation commands
  - Allow UI interaction during long-running debug operations
  - Implement cancellation for breakpoint resolution

  Decompilation:
  - Run decompilers in separate threads
  - Add caching for faster repeat access
  - Enable result streaming for large functions

  R2AI Requests:
  - Execute network requests asynchronously
  - Add timeout and retry handling
  - Provide real-time progress indicators

  5. UI Integration

  - Add persistent task status indicator to main UI
  - Create task queue inspector widget
  - Implement per-task progress reporting
  - Add notification system for task completion

  This approach maintains radare2's thread safety while allowing heavy operations to run in background without freezing
  the UI.
